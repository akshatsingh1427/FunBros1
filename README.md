## Project Overview

FunBros1 is a fast-paced 2D platformer game developed using the Godot Engine and GDScript. The game focuses on smooth movement, precise timing, and engaging enemy interactions. Players can run, jump, roll, and navigate through colorful environments filled with traps and challenges.

Currently, the game features Level 1, which is fully playable and designed to introduce the core gameplay mechanics. Level 2 is under construction and will include new obstacles, enemies, and enhanced gameplay elements in future updates.

## Key Features

- Classic 2D platformer gameplay  
- Smooth player movement and responsive controls  
- Enemy interaction mechanics such as jump kills and roll kills  
- Life-based system with respawn mechanics  
- Pitfalls and environmental traps  
- Checkpoint-based progression  
- Colorful level design  
- Level 2 under active development

## Gameplay Mechanics

- Player can run, jump, and roll  
- Enemies can be defeated by jumping on them or rolling into them  
- Falling into pits or direct enemy contact reduces player lives  
- Respawn behavior depends on the cause of death  
- Game resets to the starting point after all lives are lost  

---

## Game Design Philosophy

FunBros is designed around the principle of simple mechanics with meaningful challenge. Each gameplay element is intentionally minimal, allowing players to focus on timing, movement precision, and decision-making rather than complex controls.

The design emphasizes fair enemy encounters, clear visual feedback, gradual difficulty progression, and fast respawn cycles. This approach helps players learn from mistakes while maintaining an engaging gameplay flow.

## Technical Highlights

- Custom player movement logic for smooth and responsive controls  
- Physics-based enemy interaction handling  
- State-driven player actions such as running, jumping, and rolling  
- Modular script architecture to support future levels  
- Scalable level design framework

## Current Status

- Level 1 completed and playable  
- Level 2 under construction  
- Additional levels and features planned
